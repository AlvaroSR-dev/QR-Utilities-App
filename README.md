# Newsletter Web App

Hi! This is my first web app, it is a simple Newsletter system contected to a **MySQL** database. This app is based in two main pages:

 - **Subscription** page, where users from a website can enter their personal data to get newsletter.
 - **Administration** page, where web owners are able to manage the database using a CRUD and also bulksend emails to the whole list of people in the database.

# App Diagram 
This is an schematized diagram of how the app is going to be working, sending customers data to the database and connecting it to the CRUD page and the email bulksend page for the web owner:
